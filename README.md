# Check for errors

21. Run `eslint` to check if there are possible errors to fix:

```sh
npm run lint
```

# Server

Test that the server can be started manually:

```sh
node src/server.js
```

url: `<http://localhost:8080>`

Server can be started using three methods:

```sh
npm start -> {Normal Startup}
npm run dev -> {Dev Startup}
npm run debug -> {Debug Startup}
```
